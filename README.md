# university-assignments

The __Applied Mathematics Uni Assignments__ is a collection of my academic assignments from various courses during my Applied Mathematics Bachelor's studies at __Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology__. This GitHub repository serves as a centralized hub to store and showcase the projects and assignments completed throughout my academic journey.

By organizing my assignments in this repository, I aim to accomplish several goals. Firstly, it provides a convenient way to maintain a record of my academic work, allowing me to easily access and review my past projects whenever needed. Secondly, it enables me to demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and growth to potential employers, colleagues, or collaborators who may be interested in evaluating my abilities.
